# CovalentCreative Virtual Events Coding Challenge

Thanks for your interest in being part of the CovalentCreative engineering team! This challenge is designed to showcase your approach to web development projects, with an emphasis on architecture, code quality, and documentation. Good luck!

### Functional specification

Prototype one of the following full-stack projects:

1. **Virtual event booth:** Create a basic virtual event booth that is populated by content entered into the Django admin site. Include at least one user interaction that relies on a form submission which is recorded in the database (e.g. entering the booth raffle).

2. **Virtual event schedule:** Create a React app that displays the schedule for a virtual event (i.e. dates, times, session titles, speaker info, and descriptions). Add search functionality to filter the data on the client-side. Session info should be managed in the Django admin site.
## How we review your code

* **Functionality**: Does the application function as expected? Are core features bug-free?
* **Architecture**: Is there a reasonable separation between frontend and backend?
* **Code quality**: Is the code simple, easy to understand, and maintainable?  Are there any code smells or other red flags? Is the coding style consistent with the language's guidelines? Is it consistent throughout the codebase?
* **Documentation**: Is code well-commented? Does the README include all relevant information? See [Writing the project README](#writing-the-project-readme)
* **UX**: Is the interface understandable and pleasing to use? Is the UI mobile-responsive? Is the API intuitive?

### Writing the project README

At a minimum, your README should include:

* Instructions for local project setup, including relevant usage examples.
* A detailed description of the problems you faced, questions you asked, and the solutions you came up with.
* Trade-offs you made, anything you left out, or what you might do differently if you were to spend additional time on the project.

### Technical specification

Split the application architecture between a database, a Django backend (standard Django views and/or REST endpoints), and a React frontend that consumes the data.

### UI/UX

Use Bootstrap or a similar CSS framework to style the user interface. UX is totally up to you.
