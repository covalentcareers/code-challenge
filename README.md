# CovalentCreative Coding Challenge

Thanks for your interest in being part of the CovalentCreative engineering team! This challenge is designed to showcase your approach to web development projects, with an emphasis on architecture, code quality, UI/UX, and documentation. Good luck!

## Functional specification

Create a stripped down clone of one of your favorite web apps (e.g. Reddit, Twitter, Instagram, etc). This does not have to be a true 1:1 clone with full reproduction of all functionality, but it should include some of the core features of the platform (you decide whatâ€™s core). 

For example, a Twitter clone should be able to tweet and follow other users. A Reddit clone can create and upvote/downvote posts. An Instagram clone can post and search hashtags.

## Technical specification

Split the application architecture between a database, a Django backend, and a React frontend that consumes the data.

## UI/UX

Use Bootstrap or a similar CSS framework to style the user interface. Ensure the templates are mobile-responsive. 

UX is totally up to you!

## Code review heuristics

* **Functionality**: Does the application function as expected? Are core features bug-free? Are obvious edge cases handled?
* **Architecture**: Is there a reasonable separation between frontend and backend? Does the project structure make sense? Do various components interface with each other in a clean, modular way?
* **Code quality**: Is the code simple and easy to understand?  Are there any code smells or other red flags? Is the coding style consistent with the language's guidelines? Is it consistent throughout the codebase?
* **Documentation**: Is code well-commented? Does the README include all relevant information? See [Writing the project README](#writing-the-project-readme)
* **UX**: Is the interface understandable and pleasing to use? Is the UI mobile-responsive? Is the API intuitive?

## Writing the project README

At a minimum, your README should include:

* Instructions for local project setup
* A list of third party libraries you used, and what they handle
* Links to any courses, blog posts, or videos you referenced
* Anything else you think a well-documented project should include

## Deliverables

Send us a link to your repo!
